An overview of how biotic interactions operate within communities across scales

<br>

The manuscripts contained here provide a broad overview of species dynamics within plant communities of differeing diversities and scales. The study systems used here are tropical tree communities, however, the theories that these studies test are time tested and widely applied in other biological study systems and across disciplines. Although, some of the theories tested here are well established and have been tested before in the past, the use of recently developed ([see here for more info](http://briansedio.weebly.com/)) community scale metabolomic sampling and analyses allowed us to sample and match chemical profiles between and among species with a specificity that was not possible in the past.

### Abstract

A major goal of community ecology is to elucidate the processes that create patterns of
biodiversity. Specifically, the discipline focuses on the processes that influence community
assembly, diversity gradients, and/or species coexistence. Coexistence mechanisms have been
traditionally thought of in terms of resource competition, whereby species are able to coexist by
having different niche requirements, both biotic and abiotic, that maximize their fitness. Much of
the previous work in this arena focused on the abiotic factors that influence species coexistence.
However, many of the seminal ideas about the forces that drive abundance and coexistence
patterns hypothesized that it was differences in the nature of biotic interactions between those
species that were responsible for the observed patterns. However, due to the variability and
complexity of biotic interactions, competition was generally the only interaction to be
extensively considered. Further research gave evidence to the idea that antagonistic interactions
with natural enemies are a possible niche axis that can determine coexistence of the hosts. 

The vast number of natural enemies and the even greater number of defensive chemical
metabolites provide a probable mechanism of niche differentiation, where a species niche is
defined by those enemies that they avoid through their defenses. Advances in analytical chemical
metabolomics techniques are used in this dissertation to examine the role that more complex
interaction types play in structuring communities. More recent research utilizing these techniques
have found evidence of the role that plant chemical defenses play in mediating interactions
between plant hosts and their natural enemies. Theoretical and technical advances are combined
here to investigate the factors that drive species diversity patterns and that maintain species
coexistence in 3 principal ways: 1) by testing the relative importance of competitive interactions
among tree species across an elevational-diversity gradient in the tropical Andes (Chapters 2, 3);
2) by testing the relative importance of enemy mediated interactions via chemically-mediated
niche differences across the same elevational-diversity gradient (Chapters 3, 4); and 3) by
exploring the effects of the biotic and abiotic environments on trait patterns and community
assembly processes.

Chapter 2 investigated whether competitive interactions among tropical tree species vary
systematically across a large-scale biodiversity gradient. Using tree species data collected from a
network of permanent plots in the Bolivian Andes, I quantified the taxonomic and functional
differences of neighboring species of individuals of each species within a plot. The results
showed that the taxonomic composition of tree neighborhoods becomes more stochastic with
increasing species diversity. This suggests that competitive interactions appear to be more
unpredictable among neighborhoods of the same species in higher-diversity tree communities.
Interestingly, similar patterns were not detected in the functional trait composition of tree
neighborhoods. Taken together, the two patterns suggest that species traits maybe influenced by
the abiotic environment and that biotic interactions other than competition could be at play.

Chapter 3 investigated how enemy-mediated interactions varied over a gradient of
climate, diversity, and elevation using an ecological metabolomics approach. Defensive chemical
traits were measured from leaf compounds and used to gauge the strength of enemy mediated
interactions within communities. The results showed that chemical dissimilarity among tree
species increased with increasing community diversity and toward more benign conditions and
that evolution of chemical defenses is more rapid along these gradients. This implies that natural
enemies impose a stronger selective pressure on plant chemical defenses in more diverse
communities and in more productive climates, and that the defensive chemical compounds that
hosts use are less phylogenetically conserved in higher diversity communities. The differential
strength of biotic interactions and the greater evolutionary lability of defensive metabolites
across communities implies that these enemy mediated interactions likely play a role in the
maintenance and origin of biodiversity gradients.

Chapter 4 tested how community assembly is affected by both biotic and the abiotic
environments, by examining the relationships between two suites of plant functional traits
(chemical and morphological), and abiotic site characteristics (climate and soils). Chemical traits
were used to approximate the biotic environment while morphological traits approximated the
abiotic. The results showed systematic variation in morphological trait patterns but no similar
patterns among the chemical traits. The abiotic environment was found to have a stronger than
expected influence on chemical trait patterns, where trees may utilize chemical defenses
differently in wet and dry environments. A focus on individual chemical defensive compounds to 
gauge their influences on community assembly and dynamics would be a fruitful continuation of
this work.

Overall, this dissertation sheds light on how local biotic interactions scale up to affect larger-
scale biodiversity patterns in tropical montane ecosystems. Understanding the link between local
scale interactions and large-scale patterns is key for finding ties between complementary
research and for protecting and conserving biodiversity by accurately predicting future changes
between species.
